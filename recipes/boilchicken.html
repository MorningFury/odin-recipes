        <h3>How To Prepare Boiled Chicken</h3>
        <p1>Many recipes call for "cooked chicken" in the ingredient
             list, whether that's cubed, sliced, or shredded. Although 
             using a rotisserie chicken is a good way to add cooked 
             chicken to any meal, if you have some extra raw chicken 
             on hand you can easily boil it and add it to a variety 
             of dishes.
        </p1>
        <ul>1 whole chicken or 4 boneless chicken breasts</ul>
        <ul>4 cups water or chicken broth (enough to cover)</ul>
        <ul>1 onion, halved-unpeeled</ul>
        <ul>3 carrots, cut into chunks-unpeeled</ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>Place the chicken in a large pot, along with the onions, 
            carrots, celery, and peppercorns. Add water or broth to cover.</ol>
        <ol>Cover the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a gentle boil.</ol>
        <ol>For a whole chicken cook for about 90 minutes. For boneless chicken
             breasts, cook for 15 minutes or until no longer pink.</ol>
        <ol>Remove chicken, let cool and shred with a fork or chop the meat using
             a knife.</ol>
