    <h3>How To Prepare Chimichurri Baked Chicken</h3>

    <p1><strong><em>Chimichurri</em></strong> is a dish from Argentina that is usually served 
        over grilled chicken or steak.This is my version, which may 
        or may not be authentic.</p1>

    <ul>½ cup finely chopped fresh parsley</ul>
    <ul>2 ½ tablespoons olive oil</ul>
    <ul>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano leaves</ul>
    <ul>1 tablespoon red wine vinegar</ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>Combine parsley, 2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, oregano,
         vinegar, garlic, salt, red pepper flakes, and black pepper 
         in a bowl; mix the chimichurri thoroughly.</ol>
    <ol>Place chicken on a cutting board and remove the backbone using
        kitchen shears. Press down on the breast with the heel of your
        hand to flatten. Loosen the skin of the chicken carefully and 
        rub the chimichurri underneath, distributing it evenly. Wrap 
        the chicken in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours.</ol>
    <ol>Allow chicken to come to room temperature for no more than
        1 hour before baking.</ol>
    <ol>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</ol>
