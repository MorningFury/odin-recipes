    <h3>How To Prepare Butter Milk Fried Chicken</h3>
    <p1>I love the tangy tenderization that the <em>buttermilk</em> provides.
         After the buttermilk soak, dredge the chicken pieces in 
         seasoned flour, and fry them in hot oil <strong>until crisp</strong>> and 
         cooked.</p1>
    <ul>1 (3 1/2) pound chicken, cut into 8 pieces</ul>
    <ul>1 teaspoon black pepper</ul>
    <ul>1 teaspoon salt</ul>
    <ul>1 teaspoon paprika</ul>
    <ul>Â¼ teaspoon dried rosemary</ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>Toss together chicken pieces, black pepper, salt, paprika, rosemary, thyme, oregano, sage,
         white pepper, and cayenne in a large bowl to coat</ol>
    <ol>Stir in buttermilk until chicken is coated. Refrigerate for 6 hours.</ol>
    <ol>Combine flour, salt, paprika, cayenne, garlic powder, white pepper, and onion powder in a large shallow dish.</ol>
    <ol>Remove chicken from the buttermilk and dredge each piece in the seasoned flour. Shake off any excess and transfer to a plate.</ol>
